Implemented code katas in Clojure, katas from codekata.pragprog.com

I wanted to learn Clojure for a while but never made much progress
beyond the level of where I had a running slime connection to Clojure
and had a simple initial leiningen project file for a web project with
ring. I just got distracted by other stuff but more importantly, I had
no goal for a web project, so I already failed with thinking about
what I would build. Consequently, I stopped reading Fogus and Housers 
nice book [Joy of Clojure](http://joyofclojure.com/).

After quite a while (close to a year), I stumbled upon some posts
reminding me of the code katas on the pragmatic programmers web
site. Somehow this triggered the idea that doing these katas might be
a good way to learn Clojure finally. You'll find in the subdirectories
the various katas with task description, code I wrote for solving them
and some documentation on the various solutions.
